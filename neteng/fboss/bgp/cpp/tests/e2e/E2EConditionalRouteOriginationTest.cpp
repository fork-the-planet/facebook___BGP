/*
 * E2E tests for conditional route origination (require_nexthop_resolution).
 *
 * A conditional local route is originated and advertised only while its
 * configured nexthop is resolved (i.e. an NDP/ARP neighbor is present for it).
 * When that neighbor is lost -- e.g. the egress port goes down and
 * FsdbNeighborWatcher reports the nexthop as unresolved -- the route must be
 * withdrawn from the RIB and un-advertised to peers promptly.
 *
 * These tests drive the full RibDC + PeerManagerBase path with only the FIB
 * mocked. Conditional origination is a RibDC-only feature, so this target links
 * :e2e_test_fixture_dc. Resolution changes are delivered the way production
 * delivers them: a NexthopResolutionUpdate on the RIB-in queue, exactly as
 * FsdbNeighborWatcher pushes it from FSDB neighbor-table diffs.
 *
 * Regression coverage for S661800 / T270671727, where a conditional VIP stayed
 * in the RIB and advertised for ~5 minutes after its nexthop's NDP entry was
 * removed on port-down.
